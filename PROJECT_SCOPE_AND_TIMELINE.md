## 💡 Key Decisions Needed

1. **Scope**: Full replica vs MVP vs Phased approach?
2. **Timeline**: How quickly do you need this?
3. **Budget**: What's the budget for development?
4. **Priorities**: Which features are absolutely critical?
5. **Resources**: How many developers? Full-time or part-time?

## 📝 Current Status Summary

**Completion**: ~10-15% of total project
**Time Invested**: ~40-50 hours equivalent
**Time Remaining**: ~400-500 hours for full replication

## 🎬 Next Actions

**You Should:**
1. Review the COMPLETE_FEATURE_INVENTORY.md
2. Decide on scope (Full vs MVP vs Phased)
3. Prioritize which features are critical for launch
4. Determine timeline and budget constraints

**I Can:**
1. Continue implementing features systematically
2. Focus on your highest priority items first
3. Provide estimates for specific feature sets
4. Build an MVP first, then expand

---

**The Bottom Line**: We've built a solid foundation (10-15% complete), but completing EVERYTHING will take 6-12 months of full-time development. Let me know which direction you want to go, and I'll continue building accordingly.
